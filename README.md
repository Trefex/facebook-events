Facebook Group Events Joomla Module
===============

Joomla Module for fetching Facebook Group Events


This *module* works in Joomla 3.3+ and fetches current and past events of a Group
page. All you have to do is provide an FB App ID and Secret and a Group page
ID and you're good to go.

**All** issues and feature requests should be made via github only.

See the images below or in the screenshots folder to see the *module* in action
